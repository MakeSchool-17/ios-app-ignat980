				<string>This is a great game to train memorization and concentration.
                    
You will need to create &quot;chains&quot; of objects from different categories.
The idea is not only to listen for the item right before your&apos;s in the series (so you know when it&apos;s your turn), but also to make sure that when you pass an item to someone else, that someone else actually hears you.  Make sure to have eye contact when linking your item to the next person.
If not, then repeat your item, to ensure the series does not get broken.</string>

                <string>A great exercise to train scene start-ups. 2 players initiate a scene; the scene is broken off after 3 lines. The goal is to establish as much as possible as fast as possible. The point is to understand the who, what and where of a scene, the characters, the environment and the points of view or drivers of the characters.
                    Once 3 lines of dialogue have been said, restart and do a different scene.</string>

				<string>Excellent game to train listening skills.

This game is basically a scene one sentence at a time, and the players really analyze the detail of each line. Whenever somebody wants to say a line of dialogue, they have to say &quot;You said&quot; and repeat the previous line of dialogue, then say &quot;I feel&quot; and explain what they are currently thinking about regarding the previous line of dialogue, and finally say &quot;That means&quot; and their line of dialogue. </string>

2 players. They have to construct sentences, one word at a time. While they say their word, they have to act out a paddle swing to the other person as if they are "passing" the same sentence back and forth. The goal is to construct sensible lines that tell a story with your characters.</string>

				<string>Excellent improv game to train listening and context skills.

2 or more players, one temporarily leaves the room (the criminal) so they cannot hear. Pick a crime, an accomplice, and a place.
The idea is that criminal needs to guess the crime, the accomplice, and the place. The cops need to provide hints to the criminal, but they cannot explicitly tell the criminal what the crime is, who the accomplice is, and where the crime took place.
They need to give indirect details related to the crime details. If the accomplice is Abraham Lincoln, the cops could mention a tall honest man, pennies, the $5 bill, or civil liberites.</string>
